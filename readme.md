# AdventOfCode 2025
Solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 programming puzzles.

# How to Use
You need to use your own input files to run the solutions. This can be automated by creating a `.env` file with the
format `AOC_SESSION=<your_session_cookie>`. Alternatively, you can manually grab each input file in the format
`input/dayN.txt`.

# How to Build
This project uses my custom zero dependency bootstrapped build system called
[CSBuild](https://github.com/ConnorSweeneyDev/CSBuild).\
On Windows, run `script\build.bat`. On Linux, run `./script/build.sh`.
